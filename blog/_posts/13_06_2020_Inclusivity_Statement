# Inclusivity Statement

*** At the Wallace Lab we believe in equity, diversity, and inclusion in science. We believe in the importance of a safe and equal environment for all. Therefore, we as a lab are strongly against any form of racism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, ableism, or discrimination based on religion. We strive to support our colleagues, to amplify the voices of BIPOC and LGBT+ minorities, and to speak up when needed. We are in on-going pursuit of open conversation and accountability, to be better colleagues and to make science more accessible for everyone. ***
