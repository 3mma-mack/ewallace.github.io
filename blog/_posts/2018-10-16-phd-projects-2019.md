We are advertising PhD projects for 2019 entry, on different aspects of how fungi dynamically reorganize their RNA and protein to adapt to environmental change. They will all provide training in experimental and computational biology. They differ in their emphasis on gene expression in response to environmental signals, on RNA-protein interactions, or on fungal pathogenesis, and in the fantastic 2nd supervisors.

## Projects for students from anywhere in the world, including the UK

These projects are based in Edinburgh:

* [How fungi navigate their environment: what drives gene expression patterns in new lab infection models of a major fungal pathogen?](https://www.findaphd.com/search/ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=101105), with [Dr. Elizabeth Ballou]().
* [How fungi manage stress: the role of RNA binding proteins in post-transcriptional adaptations to heat shock](https://www.findaphd.com/search/ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=101106), with [Dr. Atlanta Cook](http://cook.bio.ed.ac.uk/).


## Projects for UK/EU students

This project is collaborative with [Prof. Alistair Brown](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ims/profiles/al.brown) at the [MRC Centre for Medical Mycology](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/cmm/) at the University of Aberdeen, as part of the BBSRC/[EASTBIO](http://www.eastscotbiodtp.ac.uk/) doctoral training program:

* [How do RNA-binding proteins regulate fungal cell walls and environmental adaptation?](https://www.findaphd.com/search/ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=101173)

## How to apply

To apply, first email [Edward Wallace](team/edward-wallace) for more information! [Describe your interest in the project in specific terms](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/postgraduate/apply/contacting-supervisors). The ideal email would say why you are interested in the subject matter (i.e. some combination of fungi, pathogens, stress adaptation, RNA, and sequencing methods), and also briefly describe your experimental and computational skills. 

Application deadlines for funding are in **December 2018**.

We would be very happy to get enquiries, on these or related projects, from students with their own funding or who are applying to independent funding from foundations or governments.

## More context PhD applications and the UK system

For more on how the application system works, see the very useful [guide to the UK academic system](http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/ftp/pdf/The_UK_Academic_system.pdf) by [Geoff Barton](http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/).
